# 🚨 Plesk Sentry

Small, lightweight PHP based  tool to keep your Plesk server safe by from pesky bruteforcers by scanning logfiles and detecting suspicious activities. Aiming to be bit more flexible than fail2ban.

## What it does

- 📝 Scans Plesk server logfiles for violations
- 🤖 Can be scheduled via cron for regular scanns
- 📊 Provides logging/reports via cron notification
- 🚷 Detects and bans bruteforce attempts in a configurable manner

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.2
- A Plesk server (obviously 😉)
- That's it!

## Future Ideas

- 📧 Custom Email notifications/reports for critical events
- 🌐 API integration for external monitoring
- 🧮 More flexible and configurable rulesets/presets
- 🚀 Webhooks
